# wfo-tens

Repo for TEN related Files. 

**IPNI**

Currently this is a repository for new names being added to WFO's taxonomic management tool Rhakhis via the monthly IPNI workflow. New names are extracted and added here for TENs to be made aware, both as a reporting mechanism and also to share those records and identifiers with TENs that have external databases.

Each TEN will have a folder where their monthly names are placed. If there is no folder there are no new names currently.

There are two monthly log files. One listing the groups with new names and one that records a null result.
