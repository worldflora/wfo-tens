# wfo-tens
A repository tracking tens contributions and todos

**IPNI**

Currently this is a repository for new names being added to WFO's taxonomic management tool Rhakhis via the monthly IPNI workflow. New names are extracted and added here for TENs to be made aware, both as a reporting mechanism and also to share those records and identifiers with TENs that have external databases.
