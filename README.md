# wfo-tens

Repo for TEN related Files. 

**IPNI**

Currently this is a repository for new names being added to WFO's taxonomic management tool Rhakhis via the monthly IPNI workflow. New names are extracted and added here for TENs to be made aware, both as a reporting mechanism and also to share those records and identifiers with TENs that have external databases.

Each TEN will have a folder where their monthly names, if any, are placed. There will be a Result's log for each month in the parent year folder. If there is no folder there are no new names currently.
